  https://guides.library.ucla.edu/geospatial/tutorials recommends the completion of https://geo-python.github.io/site/ and https://automating-gis-processes.github.io/2017/index.html
  I would like to thank Geo-Python for making these courses available to the public
  This repository is where I will upload exercises as I work through these courses
